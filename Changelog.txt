Changelog for ETS2 Savegame Editor
 =================================================================================================================================
Changes Version 2.0 Beta
=================================================================================================================================

Everything changed. Except var. Var never changes.
Datastructures and Data-handling changed from attribute-based handling to unit-based handling.
The basic functions of the editor are now located in an .dll file that you can use for your own save-editing projects.
	(Documentation is missing, will be added later, when the final release of V2 is out)
GUI is now a seperate program that utilizes the libary files (.dll)

Development Changes:
 - Updated to .NET Framework v4.7.1 (as of now v4.7.2 is latest available .NET Framework release)
 - Ported project files to Visual Studio 2019
 - Program is more efficient in terms of CPU, but in exchange requires a few MB more RAM.
 	(No changes in overall in comparison to v1.x)
 - Tests were performed on Windows 10 (64 bit) 1809 and 1903/1905 always with latest public/stable updates installed
 - Tested on Game versions 1.33.xs (final), 1.34.xs (beta and final) and 1.35.xs (beta)
 
 General Changes:
 - You have to select a backup path and a savepath for the savegames in order to edit the original savegame.
 - Program now checks on startup if the required version for .NET Framework is installed
 - When loading a savegame, the program now also checks if the file is decrypted and throws an error if not.

Libary changes:
 - Initial release.
 - Loads of functions that handle the data. (Instead of two big functions as in v1.x)
 - Support for some future features. (hint: the word has 8 letters)

GUI (Main Program) changes:
 - Initial release.
 - Reworked GUI
 - Streamlining of the GUI, also changed GUI element names.
 - Added logging support: The program automatically creates a logfile in the directory that you are in
 	(needs to be enabled by default in final release). Please provide this log file if you are reporting a crash.
  - Disabled / Hid GUI elements related to features that are not implemented / ready yet.

/!\/!\/!\ IMPORTANT
Some features from the first versions (v1.x) are not working or implemented yet. Use Version 1 releases in this case.
