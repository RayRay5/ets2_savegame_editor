# README ets2_savegame_editor

.NET Framework (C#) version 4.6 is required

No other special files or libaries are required

Compiled binary files can be found in ~/executables/


This is a WIP and will be updated once in a while. **This program does work with ETS2 AND ATS Savegames**


Short "how to use":

Click "Open File" to load the ETS2 savegame file

Before you open a savegame file, make sure that it is decrypted.

You can find the Savegame Decypter over here

**I am looking around for a solution that is serious and staable**

You will be able to create a backup, just enter a filename or create/select it in the Explorer.

If you don't want to create a backup, just leave the textfield empty


Analyze will analyze the savegame data. You can skip this if you are an expert and enter the values to wish directly. However you will be able to modify your garages only if you analyzed your savegame.


In the garage explorer you will see all garages and some other stuff, ignore that, changing that will mess around with your savegame.

Click "upgrade garage" or "downgrade garage" to increase or decrease the level of your garage

Level 0 (color: dark red): You don't own this garage

Level 1 (color: red): Tiny garage

Level 2 (color: orange): Small garage

Level 3 (color: (olive-)green): Big garage


Click "Apply Settings" to apply all changes. Select "don't change" if you don't wish the value to be changed



**NOTICE: I can't gurantee that this program does not mess up your savegame. Use the backup function.
Tests with several of my savegames were working fine, yet there are still a few minor issues that might mess with it.**
